## What I learn

1. I learn what the method addEventListener is and how to utilize it properly. I also learn you can add class to your HTML from JavaScript with functions.

### Code I am proud of: 

<code>const btn = document.querySelector(".switch-btn")
const video = document.querySelector(".video-container")</code>

My first time using and understanding querySelectors.


## Deployment
I deployed by project with [Netlify](https://subtle-cassata-6abccc.netlify.app/)
